HIGH PRIO:
 Modify buzhug to return dicts (~25% boost) or lists ? (even more ?)
 Add Hide icon to hide top bar and playlist (near shuffle ? move shuffle to uri bar ?)

LOW PRIO:
 Manage some configuration (list of hosts etc...)
 Add tooltip for shuffle button

 Add playlist management to the view
  - inject (local file or directory)
  - delete
  - drag & drop
 Add a Delete button under playlist (should hide with playlist)

 UI:
  Review alignments ?
  Contextual menu in list (with delete etc...)

FUTURE:
 Add tarball download to http interface

 Separate artist db:
  - artist view possible
  - difflib matching on insert
  much slower ?? (to test...)

 Tags edition ? add pure "tags" + ratings (user defined)

 Add shoutcast/jamendo/lastfm support

BUGS:
  statusbar on search errors/next sometimes takes time to refresh
  Scrollbar freezes (mplayer is blocking the notifier: thread ?)
