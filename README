FUTURE:

 Tags edition ? add pure "tags" + ratings (user defined)
 Better tags management ? (check m4a files)

 Add playlist management to the view
  - display
  - inject (local file or directory)

  Add shoutcast/jamendo/lastfm support

 UI:
  Review alignments ?
  Make title & artist in bold font

 Refactor:
  make actions separate files (split zshell.py)

BUGS:
  statusbar on search errors/next
  Scrollbar freezes
  Search is very limited (but fast) right now, add hybrid mode ?
