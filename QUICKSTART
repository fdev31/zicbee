If you need player features, install zicbee-mplayer

# read some help (to start, you only need to know "scan" command)
./run.py help
./run.py scan $HOME/Music/

# start the daemon
./run.py serve &

# query the database
./run.py search artist: black or title: guitar

# plays some nice music
./run.py play artist: bj√∂rk

... That' all !
You may want to visit http://127.0.0.1:9090/ to access the web interface

NOTE: if you installed zicbee system-wide,
   you may use "zicdb" from any directory instead of using "run.py".
   Also check "zicserve" as an alias to "zicdb serve".
