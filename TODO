IDEAS:
  * video support
  * picture support
      (merge with imgplayer.js ?)
  * add update support from syntax
    * example: `artist: Rolling album: stone tags: rock`
  * separate zicdb into zicdb (database/local maintenance) / zicbee (player/remote control)
  * re-write zicbee in C (the executable, not the project !)
    * have python fallback (use code generation from cmd/requests description?)
  * upnp/dlna support
  * database operations (difference, merge, substract, etc...)
  * let choice of multiples players/backends
  * allow alternative databases synchronization (SQL, XML, ...)
  * unify output format (re-architecture output operations)
    * add support for rss/rdf/atom formats as output
  * add file transcoder functions (on a given database)
    * could be available via text and www
  * add more formats to the player on www "live" (flash ? :( )
  * add "size" lookup option, limiting the size of the answer (in s)
    * add advanced "skip" option, to skip a number of entries
    * add advanced "limit" option, to limit the number of entries answered


For *1.1*: (architecture cleanup)
 * write some backends detection and loading
 * need to split zicdb executable ?
 * Much more doc
 

Before *1.0*: (very useable, db schema freeze)
 * distribution cleanup
 * add themes support for www player (and DB ?)
 * good duplicates detection

Before *0.9*:
 * cleaner javascript/cookies/sessions
 * satisfying duplicates detection
 * rating/tag fully working
 * stored playlists (including position)
    * inc. playlist resume
    * www and text interface

Before *0.8*: (slight feature/stable)
 TODO:
 * integrate/complete tag & scoring support
 * admin features (scan a path, list/switch db)
 DONE:
 * add support for FLAC

<--- *WE ARE HERE*

*0.7* (cleanup/refactor):

 * add play, pause, next, prev, list
 * add cleaner configuration:: more unified (prepare themes handling)
   -> ensure default host is well given
 * public repositories (Hg) setup
 * add some docs on the website
 * add screenshots on website

*0.7*-rc1 (first public release)
 * site launch
 * fixes egg/root installation (temporary file created)

*the underground* (unreleased mode, use mercurial to recover)
 RIP:
  * gtk player (many flavors tested)
  * broken gstreamer backend (player)
  * avbin (with pyglet) backend (player)
  * different mplayer wrapper
  * other flavors of www interface
  * architectural mistakes ;)
